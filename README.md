# MC102 - Algorithms and Computer Programming

MC102 is a subject in the course of Computer Engineering in the State University of Campinas offered by the Institute of Computing.

It's a great subject taught in C 99 over the course of six months.

Mine was intructed by Guido Araujo - https://guidoaraujo.wordpress.com/
